# Syntax-Error-Race2Roorkee
Hello there. 



Our team, Initiators, have decided to make a computer game(Road2Roorkee) on the godot gaming 

engine. It is a 2d multiplayer racing game which can be played by two players on 

a single computer. It consists of a single track in which whoever completes first 

wins the game. On opening the game the title screen appears in which the player 

finds two options “NEW GAME” and “CONTROLS” respectively. By clicking on the “NEW GAME” 

we are directed to the main game scene where the users can play the game. 

By clicking on the “CONTROLS” button we are directed to the controls action of the 

game where it is shown how to control your car. (It is shown for both the players). 

On the top left corner of the controls section you will find a button which will 

redirect you to the title page. On the bottom right corner you will find a button which 

will redirect you to the play section where both the players can play the game and enjoy. 

Upon winning the game the game section displays whichever car that wins.


The Main Game is saved as RACE2ROORKEE having the Godot engine icon.  

Hope you enjoy the Game!!!
